1.position
  eg:
  li{
    color:red;
    color:blue;
  }
  we see the blue color on the screen.
  least one takes more priority.

2.specificity

we can specify with 4 types of selectors.

-->element
-->class
-->id

here also same the least one takes priority.
id will take action and appears on screeno.

type of css file
-->external - third prioritu
-->internal - 2nd prioritu
-->inline - 1st priority.

importance keyword

--> if we mention any importance keyword in the css property
it says that it is important other than any elements (whether)
it is inline or external or it can be anything.

p{
    color: white !important; //adding the important keyword to the css property.
}

the above all are the cascading style sheet rules it mainly works on these 4 aspects
1.position
2.specificity.
3.type.
4.important.
